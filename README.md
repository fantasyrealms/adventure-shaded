# adventure-shaded

This repo builds a **shaded "uber" JAR** that bundles
the [adventure][adventure]
and [adventure-platform][adventure-platform] libraries.

### Why?

Adventure is split across over 15 modules, which is great â€” but for my use cases,
this is not desirable.
This project makes it easier by bundling them into one jar.

### Current Versions

* **Adventure**: `4.17.0`
* **Adventure Platform**: `4.3.3`
